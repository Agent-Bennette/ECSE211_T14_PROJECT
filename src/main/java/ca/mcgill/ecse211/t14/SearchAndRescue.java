	 * This method locates the stranded vehicle within the search zone.
	 * Upon entering the search zone, the robot will use the provided search zone coordinates and <code>UltrasonicWatcher</code> to orient itself perpendicular to the left wall of the search zone.
	 * Using <code>LineWatcher</code>, the robot will orient itself along a grid line. The robot will then perform a sweep from that grid line toward the right direction, simultaneously polling distances.
	 * A variable <code>OBJECT_DETECTION_THRESHOLD</code> is set to a distance of 10 cm. In the case that a polled distance falls below this 10 cm threshold, a boolean variable <code>objectDetected</code> indicates that an object has been detected.
	 * The robot then navigates such that it is a distance of 10 cm from the detected object. A variable <code>CART_DETECTION_ANGLE</code> set to 60ยบ is used to distinguish the stranded cart from other detected objects.
	 * Using <code>UltrasonicWatcher</code> the robot performs a sweep of the detected object. A variable <code>OBJECT_ANGLE</code>is calculated based on the rising/falling edges of when the ultrasonic sensor detects an object and when it does not.
	 * If the computed <code>OBJECT_ANGLE</code> is within 3ยบ of the set <code>CART_DETECTION_ANGLE</code>, then the method confirms that the detected object is the stranded vehicle.
