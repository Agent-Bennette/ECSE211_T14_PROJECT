	/**
	 * This method locates the stranded vehicle within the search zone.
	 * Upon entering the search zone, the robot will use the provided search zone coordinates and <code>UltrasonicWatcher</code> to orient itself perpendicular to the left wall of the search zone.
	 * Using <code>LineWatcher</code>, the robot will orient itself along a grid line. The robot will then perform a sweep from that grid line toward the right direction, simultaneously polling distances.
	 * A variable <code>OBJECT_DETECTION_THRESHOLD</code> is set to a distance of 10 cm. In the case that a polled distance falls below this 10 cm threshold, a boolean variable <code>objectDetected</code> indicates that an object has been detected.
	 * The robot then navigates such that it is a distance of 10 cm from the detected object. A variable <code>CART_DETECTION_ANGLE</code> set to 60ยบ is used to distinguish the stranded cart from other detected objects.
	 * Using <code>UltrasonicWatcher</code> the robot performs a sweep of the detected object. A variable <code>OBJECT_ANGLE</code>is calculated based on the rising/falling edges of when the ultrasonic sensor detects an object and when it does not.
	 * If the computed <code>OBJECT_ANGLE</code> is within 3ยบ of the set <code>CART_DETECTION_ANGLE</code>, then the method confirms that the detected object is the stranded vehicle.

	 * This method navigates the robot around any detected object, not including the stranded cart, in order to avoid collision.
	 * Utilizing a bang-bang controller method, the error <code>distError</code> is computed by finding the difference between ideal <code>MIN_DIST</code> and the actual distance.
	 * By comparing the <code>distError</code> with threshold values, four cases are implemented: (1) the robot is on the correct heading, (2) the robot is extremely close to collision, (3) the robot is too far from the object and (4) the robot is too close to the object.
	 * Based on which case the robot is currently in with respect to the object, the necessary maneuvers are executed such that the robot remains at a comfortable distance away from the object.
	 * Once <code>detectObstacle()</code> returns false and <code>readUSDistance()</code> is at a maximum, the robot has successfully clear of the object and can proceed on its course. (Similar to the implementation logic for Lab 1 - Wall Follower).
